The Stolen Art Gallery was inspired by [Ziv Schneider](http://www.zivschneider.com/)&#8216;s [The Museum of Stolen Art](http://zivschneider.com/The-Museum-of-Stolen-Art). The modelling was done in [SketchUp](http://www.sketchup.com/) and the game is constructed in [Unity 5](http://unity3d.com/) and uses [First Person Drifter](http://torahhorse.com/first-person-drifter-controller-for-unity3d) by [Ben Esposito](http://torahhorse.com/). The art in the gallery is drawn from the [Federal Bureau of Investigation&#8217;s National Stolen Art File](http://www.fbi.gov/about-us/investigate/vc_majorthefts/arttheft/NSAF).

The Stolen Art Gallery was covered on [Kill Screen](http://killscreendaily.com/articles/pippin-barr-virtual-art-gallery-contains-no-art-but-lots-questions/) and [Warp Door](http://wip.warpdoor.com/2015/05/15/the-stolen-art-gallery-pippin-barr/).
